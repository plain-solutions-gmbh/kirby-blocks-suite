## You cannot:

Re-distribute the Item as a stock image or its source files, even with modifications. In other words, you cannot replicate or modify the item and sell it as a theme/product on any marketplace as your own.

## Other license terms:

Some blocks of the Item may have different license terms from elsewhere, such as someone else's license or an open source or creative commons license. If this is the case, the block will be identified in the Item's description page or in the Item's downloaded files. The other license will apply to that block, and this license will apply to the rest of the Item. You can find all these blocks on our website (plain-solutions.net).

## Security & Payments

We process all payments securely through Paddle and Lemon Squeezy (PayPal or Stripe). We do not process payments directly through our website.

## Updates & Support

Minor and patch updates are provided for the Plugin. Major updates and support are available as specified on the purchase page.

You can test the product before you buy the license, therefore we do not provide refunds for digital products. If you have any issues receiving or downloading our products, please contact us for assistance.

## Support Policy

We are committed to providing support for Plain Solutions GmbH plugins and themes. Our free theme support covers bug fixes, help with theme settings, and minor modifications. We can guide you on how to make these modifications yourself. However, adding new features or changing how the theme works falls outside the scope of regular theme support.
As a small team, our response time is usually between 2-4 days.
