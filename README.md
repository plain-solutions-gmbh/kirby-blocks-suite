## Installation

**Manually**

[Download](https://github.com/plain-solutions-gmbh/kirby-blocks-suite) and unzip the content into your plugin folder: `/site/plugins/`

**With Composer**

```bash
composer require getplain/kirby-blocks-suite
```

**Before we start...**

Skip this chapter if you intend to work directly on a project with this plugin.


But if you like to rebuild the examples in this documentation, follow these steps:

* Install the [Kirby starterkit](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/quickstart#installing-kirby) and make it running (e.g. on `localhost`).
* Create these files *(If you read  **Page Blueprint** or **Page Template** in this manual use these files)*:

    _Page Blueprint (/site/blueprints/pages/demo.yml):_
    ```yml
    title: My Page Builder
    # Blueprint code goes here:
    ```

    _Page Template (/site/templates/demo.php):_
    ```php
    <?php snippet('header') ?>
      <!-- Template code goes here: -->
    <?php snippet('footer') ?>
    ```

    _Content (/content/demo/demo.txt):_
    ```
    Title: My Page Builder
    ```

* Go to `localhost/panel/pages/demo`

# Features

## Use a single block

On top of the *Blocks Field* you can use now the *Block Field*:

_Page Blueprint (/site/blueprints/pages/demo.yml):_
```yml
fields:
  fruits:
    label: Types of fruit
    type: block
    fieldset: list
```

_Page Template (/site/templates/demo.php):_
```php
<?= page()->fruits()->toBlock() ?>
```

**Panel output:**

<img src="./.github/single_block.png" alt="Single Block" width="350" height="auto">

As you see: All fields that are usually displayed in the block's drawer, appears now in the panel window.

> üí• You can use now blocks like an *[Object Field](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/object)*.

## One place for your blocks

No more jumping between the *blueprints* and the *snippets* folder. Use the `site/block` folder for your block collection.

|  | With Kirby Blocks | With Blocks Suite |
| :-------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Blueprint | site/blueprints/blocks/my_block.yml | site/blocks/my_block/my_block.yml |
| Snippets | site/snippets/blocks/my_block.php | site/blocks/my_block/my_block.php |
| Preview | /site/plugins/my_block/index.php<br>/site/plugins/my_block/index.js<br>/site/plugins/my_block/components/my_block.vue | (managed in blueprint) |


**Example:**

_Article Block Blueprint (/site/blocks/article/article.yml):_
```yml
title: Article
icon: file-document

fields:
  title:
    type: text
  text:
    type: writer
  image:
    type: files
    multiple: false
```

_Article Block Template (/site/blocks/article/article.php):_
```html
<article class="note-excerpt">
  <header>
      <figure class="img" style="--w: 16; --h:9">
          <img src="<?= $content->image()->toFiles() ?>" alt="<?= $content->title() ?>">
      </figure>

    <h2 class="note-excerpt-title"><?= $content->title() ?></h2>
  </header>
  <div class="note-excerpt-text"><?= $content->text() ?></div>
</article>
```

The new Block is set up. And now we need to make it useable. For that we create a *blocks field* as we know from Kirby CMS.

_Page Blueprint (site/blueprints/pages/demo.yml):_
```yml
fields:
  section:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - article
```

**Panel output:**

<img src="./.github/article.png" alt="Screenshot article" width="350" height="auto">


To use it in your template, use the [toBlocks method](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/blocks#blocks-in-your-templates):


_Page Template (site/templates/demo.php):_

```html
<?php snippet('header') ?>

  <?= $page->my_blocks()->toBlocks() ?>

<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```


## Insert a block manually

If you like to use a block hard-coded in your template. Nothing easier than that:

```php
block('article', [
  'title'		=> 'My custom article',
  'text'	  => 'Some exciting text',
  'image'		=> 'file://id-of-your-image',
])
```

## Reuse Blocks

Sometimes it could be useful to use a block with the same output twice, but with a different view in the panel.
In our example, we like to use our article block to view the team on our website.

All you need to do is to add a custom fieldset with the property `type` and overwrite desired props.

_Page Blueprint (site/blueprints/pages/demo.yml):_
```yml
fields:
  section:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - article
      team:
        type: article
        title: Team
        icon: account
        fields:
          title:
            label: Name
            required: true
          
```

Now we can add article and team. Everything with one type of block:

<img src="./.github/extends.png" alt="Screenshot extends" width="350" height="auto">

> üí° You can adding new fields if you like.<br>üí° To _remove_ fields, hide them with `type: hidden`.<br>üí° Set default values per field with the `default` property: `default: My default value`

## Preview

Creating a preview could be a very time-consuming thing. In addition, fields that are displayed in the preview appear once again in the drawer.<br/>Now you have full control over your preview right in your blueprint with the `preview` property.


### Single field for preview

This example shows the field `title` in the preview. All the other fields can be found in the drawer.

_Article Block Blueprint (/site/blocks/article/article.yml):_
```yml
...
preview:
  field: title
...
```

<img src="./.github/preview.png" alt="Screenshot preview" width="350" height="auto">

> üî• The preview is collapsible and can be hidden/shown by clicking the angle icon. The state will be saved in your browser.<br/>
> üí° In case you're using `preview`, the drawer doesn't open automaticly on block creation. (Unless `wysiwyg: false` is set)

### Multiple fields for preview

To move more than one fields from the drawer to the preview use the `fields` property:

```yml
preview:
  fields:
    - title
    - image
```

> üí° If you like to use **all** fields for preview, set `preview: true`.

### Tabs for preview

If your block using tabs you can define a tab for the preview. The preview tab is no longer visible in the drawer.

```yml
preview:
  tab: my_preview_tab
```

> üí° If your blueprint doesn't have tabs use `tab: content`.

### Header preview

`name`, `label`, `√¨con` and `image` of the preview's header can be taken from the content.<br/> To use this, add one or more of these properties to the preview array with the name of the desired field.

_Article Block Blueprint (/site/blocks/article/article.yml)_
```yml
preview:
  name: title
  label: text
  image: image
```

<img src="./.github/preview_header.png" alt="Screenshot extends" width="450" height="auto">

> üí° If `image` is set, the `icon` disappears.

**More options...**

Elements in the preview header can have more options. To use more options, set the name of the field in an own property `field`.

- `field`: The name of the field.
- `options` _(optional)_: Works like a converter. _(See the example)_
- `default` _(optional)_: Defines the value if the value is empty or not in the options list (if `options` is given).

Example: Let's say the `√¨con` is `user` unless the field `title` contains a specific value.

```yml
preview:
  field: title
  label: title
  icon:
    field: title
    default: user
    options:
      'K.I.T.T.': car
      'Michael': star
      'Devon': pen
      'April': cog
```

<img src="./.github/preview_options.png" alt="Screenshot subblock" width="450" height="auto">

> üí° The item `image` has different [options](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/files#image-options).<br/>
> üí° If `default` is not set, kirby takes the information of the fieldset. There you can do something like `label: "Titel: {{title}}"`.

### Block Width

The `width` of the block can be also taken from the value. This can be done the same like described in the last chapter. You can use `field`, `default` and `options`.

<img src="./.github/width.png" alt="Screenshot width" width="450" height="auto">

But there is a new property: `format`

| Key | Description |
| :-------- | :------------- | 
| Columns (default) | The given value defines the times the block fits in the row. |
| Fraction | The value returns the part of the whole row. (e.g 2/3) |
| Options | The value will be converted (see `options` key) |
| (any number) | `format` will be devides by the value. (e.g. 12: 6 equals the half) | 
| (any chars) | Any other expression is used for the postfix (e.g. px, em, %) |


We define the field `columns` later in this manual. But you can set the preview property right now:

_Article Block Blueprint (/site/blocks/article/article.yml)_
```yml
preview:
  width: columns
...
```

## Nesting Blocks

Blocks can cascade very easily by using the `block` or the `blocks` field inside a block.

_Example:_ We create a block to wrap sections around our blocks. 

_Section Block Blueprint (/site/blocks/section/section.yml):_
```yml
title: Section
icon: grid-top-left
preview: true

fields:
  items:
    label: Items
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - article
      team:
        type: article
        title: Team
        icon: account
        fields:
          title:
            label: Name
            required: true
```

_Section Block Template (/site/blocks/section/section.php)_
```html
<ul class="grid">
    <?php foreach ($content->items()->toBlocks() as $section): ?>
        <li class="column" style="--columns: 4">
            <?= $section ?>
        </li>
    <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
```
_Page Blueprint (site/blueprints/pages/demo.yml):_
```yml
page_builder:
  label: Page builder
  type: block
  fieldset: section
```

## Subblocks

Subblocks are useful to group blocks that belong together or to outsource some parts of a block.

See here a folder structure to understand, how subblocks works:

<img src="./.github/subblock.png" alt="Screenshot subblock" width="150" height="auto">

To use a subblock set `fieldset: my_block/my_subblock` in a block(s) field.

Let's create a subblock which we use in the next chapter:

_Section Block Blueprint (/site/blocks/section/style.yml):_
```yml
title: Style
icon: cog

fields:
  columns:
    type: toggles
    required: true
    default: 1
    options:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
      - 4
```

## Inject blocks

You can use blocks as tabs in another blocks. Sounds complex, but once you understood the concept behind, it could be a very powerful tool.<br/>
To use this feature, just set the `tabs` property in your block or blocks fields with your desired blocks. Let's take a look in our example:

_Section Block Blueprint (/site/blocks/section/section.yml):_
```yml
title: Section
icon: grid-top-left
preview: true

fields:
  items:
    label: Items
    tabs: 
      - section/style
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - article
      team:
        type: article
        title: Team
        icon: account
        fields:
          title:
            label: Name
            required: true
```
This affects, that all blocks (defined in the fieldset's properties) appears as tab in the blocks drawer.

<img src="./.github/injections.png" alt="Screenshot injections" width="350" height="auto">

**Set position**

By default, the injected blocks appear after the regular tab. You can change the order by setting `position: before`

```yaml
tabs:
  style:
    type: section/style
    position: before
```

**Extend existing tabs**

If the name of the tab already exists in the selected block, the fields of the tab will be merged by the injected block.<br/>
In our example, the `article` block doesn't have tabs. In this case, you can use `content` to modify/add fields.

```yaml
tabs:
  content:
    type: section/style
    position: before

```

> üí° Use `position` to add fields before.
> üí° Injected tabs can be extend in the block definition (See chapter **Reuse Blocks**)

**Available in the template**

The injected fields are also available in the block template with `$content->columns()`. _(In our example the value is in the `$section` item)_

_Section Block Template (/site/blocks/section/section.php)_
```html
<ul class="grid">
    <?php foreach ($content->items()->toBlocks() as $section): ?>
        <li class="column" style="--columns: <?= 12 / $section->columns()->value() ?>">
          <?= $section ?>
        </li>
    <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>

```
